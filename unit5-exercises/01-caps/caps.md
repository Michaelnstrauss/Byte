## Day 5 Exercise 1 - Caps

* Write a program that opens the text file in this directory and prints it out with every word in all caps.

* What do you need to do so that there are not extra blank lines between the lines?

* Can you write a different version that opens the file, and then outputs the all caps version to a different file name?
