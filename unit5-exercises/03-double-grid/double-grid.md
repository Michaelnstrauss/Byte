## Double a grid

* An included python file will create a grid of numbers that is 5 rows tall and 10 columns wide.

* Write your own program that reads `grid.txt` and creates a new file `doublegrid.txt` that is each number from the first grid doubled.

If `grid.txt` is:

```
5 8 9 6 9 5 5 7 5 9 
7 7 5 8 5 5 5 8 8 7 
8 5 8 5 9 7 8 7 5 7 
5 8 9 5 8 5 5 7 5 8 
5 6 6 6 7 7 5 9 7 5 
```

Then after running your program, `doublegrid.txt` should be:

```
10 16 18 12 18 10 10 14 10 18 
14 14 10 16 10 10 10 16 16 14 
16 10 16 10 18 14 16 14 10 14 
10 16 18 10 16 10 10 14 10 16 
10 12 12 12 14 14 10 18 14 10 
```
