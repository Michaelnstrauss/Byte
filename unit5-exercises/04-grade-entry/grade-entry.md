#Grade entry program

* Use a loop to ask for students' first names, last names, and test score. Stop the loop when the user types in 'done.'

* The data should be saved to a file called grades.txt

* Example operation:

```
First Name: Carter
Last Name: Adams
Grade: 71.8

First Name: Rak
Last Name: Chugh
Grade: 99.0

First Name: done
```

* this would produce a grades.txt file with these contents:

```
Carter Adams 71.8
Rak Chugh 99.0
```
